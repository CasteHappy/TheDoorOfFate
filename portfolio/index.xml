      <description>Last month I uploaded a &amp;ldquo;game show&amp;rdquo; video to Diaphone&amp;rsquo;s channel where he and Jmcrofts had to guess the rank of random players in SF6.
From the beginning I knew I wanted to use the rank up animation from the actual game to reveal the results, but it was pretty much impossible for me to rip the animation, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I would have to get to every single rank myself so I could record every single one, and that&amp;rsquo;s not gonna happen lol.</description>
