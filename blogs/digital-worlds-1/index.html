  <div class="post-content"><p>Some time ago, I was watching my boyfriend play Animal Crossing on the Switch.
He was trying to build the neighborhood from the small beach town where he and his family used to go every summer because his grandparents owned an apartment. He has soooo many childhood memories of that place, and he never shuts up about going back there every time summer gets brought up in a conversation, but after some tough family problems and the passing of his late grandma, I feel like that place has gained a lot more emotional meaning for him.</p>
<p>After showing me a bunch of spots on the island, he finished the tour by going to a tiny hill by the beach where he had built a tombstone that had a pine cone next to it. He told me that he used to walk around the neighborhood with his grandma to pick up pine cones and he looks back to that memory so fondly that they became some kind of memento for him.</p>
<p>Took me a bit to process it, but I thought that was such beautiful sight. Made me start thinking about how a digital space could have so much meaning and weight for someone, and how it could also last forever as a time capsule, a snapshot from a specific time in your life than even when lacking the context for their creation, you can&rsquo;t help to put myself in the other person&rsquo;s shoes.</p>

<p>The original creator of these stages is <strong>Rafa</strong>, he played Brawl around 25 hours and <em>almost</em> completed the Subspace Emisary at 75%, props to you!</p>
