      <description>For a month or two I&amp;rsquo;ve been using sidechain compression in most of the vids I&amp;rsquo;ve edited, the result is super satisfying and lets your music choices shine without having to worry about the voiceover getting completely crushed by the songs.
Just in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know what sidechain compression is, just imagine a regular compressor that gets triggered by the signal of another track. So for example, a music track (B) will get compressed only when the voiceover (A) is playing, and when the voiceover is muted, the music won&amp;rsquo;t get compressed at all.</description>

      <description>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Caste, a self-taught video editor and fighting game competitor since around 2008. From the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had internet access I&amp;rsquo;ve always been really fascinated by video editing and graphic design, thanks to places like Emudesc (a now defunct internet forum about videogames), DeviantArt, and of course Youtube and the YTP / YTPMV community, which really got me into learning proper video editing software and sparked my interest for a lot of internet subcultures and their repective styles, music preferences, and of course their sense of humour (I&amp;rsquo;ve been here for the laughs from the beginning, you see?</description>
