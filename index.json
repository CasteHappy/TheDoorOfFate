This is the actual question:\nEverything in the foreground I made it myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve already talked about the \u0026ldquo;rank reveal\u0026rdquo; animation in this post.\nFor the zoom out animation, I just needed 2 files, a still image of the garage door background that appears when choosing characters, and a video of the transition that plays between choosing a stage and going to character select.\nFor the screnshot I disabled the HUD and used a free camera mod to get closer to the actual door so I could use it by itself as a transition (closing the door) without having to zoom in and losing quality.\nThe video is not modified at all, I only disabled the HUD and just let it play until the characters show up\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Step 1: Separate the 2 parts of the animation So the first step is to reverse the video clip so it starts at the garage door, and ends at the long hallway with neon lights. If you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a smooth transition from the hallway to the character select garage door, but the in-game graphics hide it really well, and that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the secret of the transtion.\nSo after reversing the clip, I cut it into 2 different tracks, one for the zoom animation (Track 2), and one for the hallway animation (Track 1).\nYour browser does not support the video tag. I scaled up the first clip so it exactly matches the size of the screenshot, but it's irrelevant for the effect we want.\rThe problem here is that the hallway animation always moves at the same speed, so I\u0026rsquo;ll need to fake the movement so it matches the speed of the zoom out of the first clip.\nStep 2: Position the clips correctly Now I need to align the position of both clips. As you maybe have noticed, the perspective makes it so the end of the first clip and the end of the second one, don\u0026rsquo;t match at all. The scale is also completely off.\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/tutorials/fakezoomout/","summary":"I was asked by ytrilogy1091 on Youtube about how I made this transition from one of the latest videos I\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded to Diaphone\u0026rsquo;s channel:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

He was trying to build the neighborhood from the small beach town where he and his family used to go every summer because his grandparents owned an apartment. He has soooo many childhood memories of that place, and he never shuts up about going back there every time summer gets brought up in a conversation, but after some tough family problems and the passing of his late grandma, I feel like that place has gained a lot more emotional meaning for him.\nAfter showing me a bunch of spots on the island, he finished the tour by going to a tiny hill by the beach where he had built a tombstone that had a pine cone next to it. He told me that he used to walk around the neighborhood with his grandma to pick up pine cones and he looks back to that memory so fondly that they became some kind of memento for him.\nTook me a bit to process it, but I thought that was such beautiful sight. Made me start thinking about how a digital space could have so much meaning and weight for someone, and how it could also last forever as a time capsule, a snapshot from a specific time in your life than even when lacking the context for their creation, you can\u0026rsquo;t help to put myself in the other person\u0026rsquo;s shoes.\nWith all of that out of the way, I just finished crying my eyes out after looking at some custom stages from a Super Smash Bros. Brawl save file on a Wii that I repaired today haha.\nSuper Smash Bros is a very important game series to me (and Brawl was the first one I owned), and I started thinking about how those stages were once a fun creative moment for someone, and that now they\u0026rsquo;re lost forever. I still feel dumb by getting so gloomy about something so minor that even the original creator must have forgotten about, but I feel like sharing these stages with the world even if I\u0026rsquo;m the only one that ever see them.\nLately I\u0026rsquo;ve been really interested on the Wii as a system and I keep buying faulty consoles to repair, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably find more stages, pictures and replays in the future, can\u0026rsquo;t wait to share them with you!\n(Used Brawl Stage Studio so I could see the stages on my PC)\nThe original creator of these stages is Rafa, he played Brawl around 25 hours and almost completed the Subspace Emisary at 75%, props to you!\nStage 1: PAPADOPOULOS ","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/blogs/digital-worlds-1/","summary":"Some time ago, I was watching my boyfriend play Animal Crossing on the Switch.

It was a lot easier than I thought at first, but I had no idea where to start. As always, my strat for making effects or animations is to just aimlessly mess around until it looks acceptable.\nFirst, I started getting the rank renders from SF6\u0026rsquo;s Buckler\u0026rsquo;s Bootcamp I don\u0026rsquo;t know if many people know about this, but you can check your match history from the game, and search for other players\u0026rsquo; stats, matches and whatnot.\nThis is a .zip with all the .pngs (except Legend rank): SF6 Rank renders\nI recommend using some kind of upscaling tool because the files are very small.\nCouldn\u0026rsquo;t find the \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; icon that appears before getting your first rank, so I just made it myself in Photoshop with the pen tool and a bunch of shapes. Never made lightning animations or anything similar so I just started playing around with a couple of effects in AE until I found BCC Lens Flare 3D You can modify every aspect of the lens flare and the presets are a really good starting point.\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/portfolio/SF6RankUp/","summary":"Last month I uploaded a \u0026ldquo;game show\u0026rdquo; video to Diaphone\u0026rsquo;s channel where he and Jmcrofts had to guess the rank of random players in SF6.\nFrom the beginning I knew I wanted to use the rank up animation from the actual game to reveal the results, but it was pretty much impossible for me to rip the animation, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I would have to get to every single rank myself so I could record every single one, and that\u0026rsquo;s not gonna happen lol.","title":"Recreating the Street Fighter 6 Rank Up! animation "},{"content":"For a month or two I\u0026rsquo;ve been using sidechain compression in most of the vids I\u0026rsquo;ve edited, the result is super satisfying and lets your music choices shine without having to worry about the voiceover getting completely crushed by the songs.\nJust in case you don\u0026rsquo;t know what sidechain compression is, just imagine a regular compressor that gets triggered by the signal of another track. So for example, a music track (B) will get compressed only when the voiceover (A) is playing, and when the voiceover is muted, the music won\u0026rsquo;t get compressed at all.\nAfter some research I could only find a couple of solutions for Vegas Pro, one that is native to the software, but that I really don\u0026rsquo;t trust / I find too much work for such a simple thing. And another one that requires a plugin called Sidechain Compressor V2 by dB Audioware, it\u0026rsquo;s 79 bucks, but you can get it by other means.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very serviceable, but for some reason it won\u0026rsquo;t ever save changes if you close Vegas Pro, so you have to either save the state of the plugin as a preset before closing the program, or just take a screenshot so you remember next time you open the project.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also read that you can do this with a FabFilter plugin, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t figure out how yet, and I\u0026rsquo;m honestly fine with the proccess I use now.\nHow to use the compressor The proccess is very straightforward, just create one track that will be used as the trigger for the compressor (voice track), and at least another track that will affected by it (music track, for example), then go to View \u0026gt; Window \u0026gt; Mixing Console or just press Ctrl+Alt+5 to open the Mixing Console.\nIn the Mixing Console, you have to create 2 Buses (A and B) by clicking on Insert Bus, and then clicking on the FX icon to open the effects list. Search for the Sidechain Compressor V2 plugin and add it to both buses.\nBefore doing anything with the compressor, we need to \u0026ldquo;assign\u0026rdquo; the buses to the different tracks we want for this effect. We will assign \u0026ldquo;Bus A\u0026rdquo; to the tracks that will trigger the compressor, and \u0026ldquo;Bus B\u0026rdquo; to the tracks that will be affected by the compressor. In this example, we want the voiceover in Bus A, and the music in Bus B, you can assign the buses by just clicking in the \u0026ldquo;output\u0026rdquo; option (by default this option will be \u0026ldquo;Master\u0026rdquo;).\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/tutorials/sidechain-compressor-vegas-pro/","summary":"For a month or two I\u0026rsquo;ve been using sidechain compression in most of the vids I\u0026rsquo;ve edited, the result is super satisfying and lets your music choices shine without having to worry about the voiceover getting completely crushed by the songs.\nJust in case you don\u0026rsquo;t know what sidechain compression is, just imagine a regular compressor that gets triggered by the signal of another track.

(updated as of 09/12/2025) I\u0026rsquo;m Caste, a self-taught video editor and fighting game competitor since around 2008. From the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve had internet access I\u0026rsquo;ve always been really fascinated by video editing and graphic design, thanks to places like Emudesc (a now defunct internet forum about videogames), DeviantArt, and of course Youtube and the YTP / YTPMV community, which really got me into learning proper video editing software and sparked my interest for a lot of internet subcultures and their repective styles, music preferences, and of course their sense of humour (I\u0026rsquo;ve been here for the laughs from the beginning, you see?).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a really slow learning process because I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen any of this as a professional skill, and I honestly used it as a last resort when the COVID pandemic hit. Since 2020 I\u0026rsquo;ve probably learned a lot more than in the previous 12 years, and there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot I have to explore and get good at.\nVideo Editing These are the main tools I use:\nMAGIX Vegas Pro 21 Adobe After Effects 2024 Adobe Photoshop 2024 Adobe Illustrator 2024 Reaper I also have some experience with Adobe Premiere but I GREATLY dislike its workflow. I should honestly switch to it at some point but for now I\u0026rsquo;m the biggest hater, Sony Vegas Stockholm syndrome.\nSince August 2020 I\u0026rsquo;ve been working mainly as a video editor for Diaphone (a top level fighting game player and content creator), making mostly all videos and thumbnails on the channel (around 185) and getting over 30 Million views and 170.000 suscribers. While also making some other videos and thumbnails for other smallers creators in the same space.\nPlaylist with all the vids I\u0026rsquo;ve edited\nOutside of work I\u0026rsquo;m a YTPMV / 音 MAD enthusiast and I make them from time to time, which is my favourite audiovisual genre and internet culture.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve participated in some YTPMV Collaborations, including the almost 2 hour long \u0026ldquo;The hhgregg Collab - It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Christmas in July!\u0026rdquo;, with entries from around 50 people.\nPlaylist with all the YTPMVs I\u0026rsquo;ve made\nCompetitive gaming I\u0026rsquo;ve been competing and organizing tournaments for SSB (and much later, fighting games) since around 2009 - 2010, getting repectable placements in Smash 4, Smash Ultimate, Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive. Back in 2018 I even got sponsored by \u0026ldquo;Vortex\u0026rdquo;, a now defunct local fgc team, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t last very long.

Same with music, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been less and less interested in new music for a couple of years now. I have a Backloggd and RateYourMusic account if you wanna see what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to. I\u0026rsquo;m also the biggest advocate for videogame piracy and homebrews.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also a frustrated graphic designer, I went to art school for a year but I didn\u0026rsquo;t connect with the classes so I dropped out. I still love typography and motion graphics so much.\nAs of late I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten into console repairs (mostly Wii), which I always enjoyed but found a bit inaccessible until now.
