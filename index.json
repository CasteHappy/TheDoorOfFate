[{"content":"Last month I uploaded a \u0026ldquo;game show\u0026rdquo; video to Diaphone\u0026rsquo;s channel where he and Jmcrofts had to guess the rank of random players in SF6.\nFrom the beginning I knew I wanted to use the rank up animation from the actual game to reveal the results, but it was pretty much impossible for me to rip the animation, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I would have to get to every single rank myself so I could record every single one, and that\u0026rsquo;s not gonna happen lol.\nThis is what I came up with:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. It was a lot easier than I thought at first, but I had no idea where to start. As always, my strat for making effects or animations is to just aimlessly mess around until it looks acceptable.\nFirst, I started getting the rank renders from SF6\u0026rsquo;s Buckler\u0026rsquo;s Bootcamp I don\u0026rsquo;t know if many people know about this, but you can check your match history from the game, and search for other players\u0026rsquo; stats, matches and whatnot.\nThis is a .zip with all the .pngs (except Legend rank): SF6 Rank renders\nI recommend using some kind of upscaling tool because the files are very small.\nCouldn\u0026rsquo;t find the \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; icon that appears before getting your first rank, so I just made it myself in Photoshop with the pen tool and a bunch of shapes. Never made lightning animations or anything similar so I just started playing around with a couple of effects in AE until I found BCC Lens Flare 3D You can modify every aspect of the lens flare and the presets are a really good starting point.\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/portfolio/SF6RankUp/","summary":"Last month I uploaded a \u0026ldquo;game show\u0026rdquo; video to Diaphone\u0026rsquo;s channel where he and Jmcrofts had to guess the rank of random players in SF6.\nFrom the beginning I knew I wanted to use the rank up animation from the actual game to reveal the results, but it was pretty much impossible for me to rip the animation, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I would have to get to every single rank myself so I could record every single one, and that\u0026rsquo;s not gonna happen lol.","title":"Recreating the Street Fighter 6 Rank Up! animation "},{"content":"This is a placeholder blog\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/blogs/placeholder/","summary":"This is a placeholder blog","title":"PLACEHOLDER"},{"content":"For a month or two I\u0026rsquo;ve been using sidechain compression in most of the vids I\u0026rsquo;ve edited, the result is super satisfying and lets your music choices shine without having to worry about the voiceover getting completely crushed by the songs.\nJust in case you don\u0026rsquo;t know what sidechain compression is, just imagine a regular compressor that gets triggered by the signal of another track. So for example, a music track (B) will get compressed only when the voiceover (A) is playing, and when the voiceover is muted, the music won\u0026rsquo;t get compressed at all.\nAfter some research I could only find a couple of solutions for Vegas Pro, one that is native to the software, but that I really don\u0026rsquo;t trust / I find too much work for such a simple thing. And another one that requires a plugin called Sidechain Compressor V2 by dB Audioware, it\u0026rsquo;s 79 bucks, but you can get it by other means.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very serviceable, but for some reason it won\u0026rsquo;t ever save changes if you close Vegas Pro, so you have to either save the state of the plugin as a preset before closing the program, or just take a screenshot so you remember next time you open the project.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also read that you can do this with a FabFilter plugin, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t figure out how yet, and I\u0026rsquo;m honestly fine with the proccess I use now.\nHow to use the compressor The proccess is very straightforward, just create one track that will be used as the trigger for the compressor (voice track), and at least another track that will affected by it (music track, for example), then go to View \u0026gt; Window \u0026gt; Mixing Console or just press Ctrl+Alt+5 to open the Mixing Console.\nIn the Mixing Console, you have to create 2 Buses (A and B) by clicking on Insert Bus, and then clicking on the FX icon to open the effects list. Search for the Sidechain Compressor V2 plugin and add it to both buses.\nBefore doing anything with the compressor, we need to \u0026ldquo;assign\u0026rdquo; the buses to the different tracks we want for this effect. We will assign \u0026ldquo;Bus A\u0026rdquo; to the tracks that will trigger the compressor, and \u0026ldquo;Bus B\u0026rdquo; to the tracks that will be affected by the compressor. In this example, we want the voiceover in Bus A, and the music in Bus B, you can assign the buses by just clicking in the \u0026ldquo;output\u0026rdquo; option (by default this option will be \u0026ldquo;Master\u0026rdquo;).\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/tutorials/sidechain-compressor-vegas-pro/","summary":"For a month or two I\u0026rsquo;ve been using sidechain compression in most of the vids I\u0026rsquo;ve edited, the result is super satisfying and lets your music choices shine without having to worry about the voiceover getting completely crushed by the songs.\nJust in case you don\u0026rsquo;t know what sidechain compression is, just imagine a regular compressor that gets triggered by the signal of another track.

I\u0026rsquo;m Caste, a self-taught video editor and fighting game competitor since around 2008. From the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve had internet access I\u0026rsquo;ve always been really fascinated by video editing and graphic design, thanks to places like Emudesc (a now defunct internet forum about videogames), DeviantArt, and of course Youtube and the YTP / YTPMV community, which really got me into learning proper video editing software and sparked my interest for a lot of internet subcultures and their repective styles, music preferences, and of course their sense of humour (I\u0026rsquo;ve been here for the laughs from the beginning, you see?).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a really slow learning process because I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen any of this as a professional skill, and I honestly used it as a last resort when the Covid pandemic hit. Since 2020 I\u0026rsquo;ve probably learned a lot more than in the last decade, and there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot I have to explore and get good at.\nVideo Editing These are the main tools I use:\nMAGIX Vegas Pro 21 Adobe After Effects 2021 Adobe Photoshop 2021 Reaper I also have experience with Adobe Premiere but I GREATLY dislike the workflow, and the advantages from Vegas Pro are not worth it.\nSince August 2020 I\u0026rsquo;ve been working mainly as a video editor for Diaphone (a top level fighting game player and content creator), making mostly all videos and thumbnails on the channel (around 185) and getting over 6 Million views and 70.000 suscribers. While also making some other videos and thumbnails for other smallers creators in the same space.\nPlaylist with all the vids I\u0026rsquo;ve edited\nOutside of work I\u0026rsquo;m a YTPMV / éŸ³ MAD enthusiast and I make them from time to time, which is my favourite audiovisual genre and internet culture.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve participated in some YTPMV Collaborations, including the almost 2 hour long \u0026ldquo;The hhgregg Collab - It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Christmas in July!\u0026rdquo;, with entries from around 50 people.\nPlaylist with all the YTPMVs I\u0026rsquo;ve made\nCompetitive gaming I\u0026rsquo;ve been competing and organizing tournaments for SSB (and much later, fighting games) since around 2009 - 2010, getting repectable placements in Smash 4, Smash Ultimate, Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive. Back in 2018 I even got sponsored by \u0026ldquo;Vortex\u0026rdquo;, a now defunct local fgc team, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t last very long. I also got into speedrunning around 2017.\n#22 Smash 4 Spanish Ranking (2015) Best Smash 4 player in Albacete (2014 to 2016) Best Smash Ult. player in Albacete (2019) #39 Dragon Ball FighterZ Spanish Ranking (2019) #3 Road to Red Bull Gladiators Eur. classifier (Guilty Gear Strive) Multiple Top 8 results in locals around Spain Former WR for SSBB Classic Mode (05:25) - 03/03/2017 24th out of 231 in Shovel Knight Any% (47:52) - 23/01/2020 Other interests Besides all that, I\u0026rsquo;m into videogames (who would\u0026rsquo;ve thought) and videogame criticism. Same with music, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been less and less interested in new music for a couple of years now. I have a Backloggd and RateYourMusic account if you wanna see what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to.\nAs of late I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten into console repairs (mostly Wii), which I always liked but found a bit inaccessible until now. I\u0026rsquo;m also the biggest advocate for videogame piracy, so I really enjoy learning about modding and homebrew.\n","permalink":"https://CasteHappy.github.io/TheDoorOfFate/about/","summary":"Hey!
