<p>I&rsquo;m Caste, a self-taught video editor and fighting game competitor since around 2008. From the first time I&rsquo;ve had internet access I&rsquo;ve always been really fascinated by video editing and graphic design, thanks to places like <strong>Emudesc</strong> (a now defunct internet forum about videogames), <strong>DeviantArt</strong>, and of course <strong>Youtube</strong> and the <strong>YTP / YTPMV</strong> community, which really got me into learning proper video editing software and sparked my interest for a lot of internet subcultures and their repective styles, music preferences, and of course their sense of humour (I&rsquo;ve been here for the laughs from the beginning, you see?).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a really slow learning process because I&rsquo;ve never seen any of this as a professional skill, and I honestly used it as a last resort when the Covid pandemic hit. Since 2020 I&rsquo;ve probably learned a lot more than in the last decade, and there&rsquo;s still a lot I have to explore and get good at.</p>

<h2 id="video-editing">Video Editing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#video-editing">#</a></h2>
<p>These are the main tools I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MAGIX Vegas Pro 21</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adobe After Effects 2021</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adobe Photoshop 2021</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reaper</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I also have experience with <strong>Adobe Premiere</strong> but I GREATLY dislike the workflow, and the advantages from Vegas Pro are not worth it.</p>
<p>Since August 2020 I&rsquo;ve been working mainly as a video editor for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Diaphone"><strong>Diaphone</strong></a> (a top level fighting game player and content creator), making mostly all videos and thumbnails on the channel (around 185) and getting over 6 Million views and 70.000 suscribers.

<p>Outside of work I&rsquo;m a YTPMV / 音 MAD enthusiast and I make them from time to time, which is my favourite audiovisual genre and internet culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve participated in some YTPMV Collaborations, including the almost 2 hour long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5zzrjKrCdc"><strong>&ldquo;The hhgregg Collab - It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christmas in July!&rdquo;</strong></a>, with entries from around 50 people.</p>

<p>Besides all that, I&rsquo;m into videogames (who would&rsquo;ve thought) and videogame criticism. Same with music, but I&rsquo;ve been less and less interested in new music for a couple of years now. I have a <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/u/CasteHappy/"><strong>Backloggd</strong></a> and <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~CasteHappy"><strong>RateYourMusic</strong></a> account if you wanna see what I&rsquo;ve been up to.</p>
<p>As of late I&rsquo;ve gotten into console repairs (mostly Wii), which I always liked but found a bit inaccessible until now.
I&rsquo;m also the biggest advocate for videogame piracy, so I really enjoy learning about modding and homebrew.</p>
